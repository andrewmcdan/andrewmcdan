## About me
I'm a self taught coder currently learning software engineering at Kennesaw State University. I'm working on a Bachelor's Degree, but as soon as I finish that, I'll be moving straight into a Master's program. I started coding about ten years ago with Arduino and have slowly progressed to larger and larger projects. Nowadays, I mostly work in Javascript / Node.js and C++, but occasionally I'll jump into some C#. 

I like to build things. So when I'm not writing code, I'm working on PCB's or 3D printed things. 

I like to play music. So sometimes I make software that makes make music. ...or noise if you use it wrong enough.

I like to tinker with home automation and my Home Assistant instance. Sometimes I even consider making an integration for HA. ...one day.

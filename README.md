# 👋 Welcome to AndrewMcDan’s GitHub  

Hi, I’m **Andrew McDaniel** (aka **A.McD**).  
I’m a **firefighter, software engineering student, and budding entrepreneur** who loves building things—both in code and in the physical world.  

### **Coder.** 
I’ve been programming for over a decade, starting with Arduino projects and working my way up to complex systems in **C++**, **JavaScript/Node.js**, and occasionally **C#**.  

### **Musician.** 
I love exploring the intersection of music and technology—whether that’s designing guitar pedals, creating digital instruments, or just making noise in creative ways.  

### **Maker.** 
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me designing PCBs, 3D-printing parts, or tinkering with home automation projects.
